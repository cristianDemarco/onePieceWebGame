Javascript Web Game Project. Characters and backgrounds are inspired by the One Piece series.
The project is built upon the HTML's canvas element.

This JS project is a 2D game where you are supposed to engage a duel with an enemy using a moveset.
The player's character can move around and jump. It is also provided of a moveset composed of 4 different animation which cooldown is shown by some icons under the healthbar. The HUD (Heads-Up Display) is also formed by the icons of both of the characters.

The player's character is surrounded by a red square for debug purposes.
At every refresh of the web page the background will change randomly among 7 backgrounds.

However at the current state of things the game is not provided of algorithm that allows the enemy to fulfill any actions. Therefore the player's character is the only one fully animated.

Following some images of the game.
